The most common STDs in the region are chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For instance, Canada reported a 49.3% increase in chlamydia infection from 2005 to 2014, with the highest cases recorded among males (Logie et al., 2018). Similarly, the United States, among other North American sovereign nations and dependencies, records considerable numbers of STDs annually. Sadly, the existence of different races such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asians, among others, has led to misconceived notions about individuals with STIs, making it hard for them to accept their conditions. Fundamentally, the social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories have contributed to distress among the people with STDs and increased the prevalence of preventable STDs such as HPV due to improper medications. First, the North American countries report high numbers of STDs annually. According to Reif et al. (2019), about 19 million new cases of STIs occur yearly in the United States, costing approximately $10-17 billion dollars. Indeed, the prevalence of STDs continues to increase among young adults and adolescents in the USA.

(2019) revealed that female sex workers in 13 cities in Mexico had various STDs such as HIV\/AIDs and sexually transmitted infections. The gender equality that prevailed in Brazil as a major tourist center and the large demand for healthcare services prompted sex workers to seek treatment. Unfortunately, the same problem is observed in the world\u2019s greatest tourist destinations such as the United States of America, China, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Germany, among others. In these countries, sex workers do not have equal treatment, and the rate of demand for STD treatment lags, leaving STIs and other STDs among them. Second, different races have more STDs and difficulties in accepting these conditions as a result. According to Travaglini et al. (2018), sex workers from African American states received more STD tests than any other race when tested from the general population sample at the time of testing and in the previous year. Hence, sex workers with Africa American race did not have adequate access to the necessary treatment due to discriminatory law enforcement procedures",

The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

Tracy Kidder\u2019s non-fiction narrative about pre- and post-immigration experiences of Deo, a civil war refugee from Burundi, restores my faith in humanity in terms of three different aspects \u2013 the faith in an individual, the faith in a society, and the faith into a reader of this story. The Faith in an Individual The main protagonist of Strength in What Remains , Deo can be described as a hero of our time. His story is a detailed demonstration of what kind of cultural and emotional shock immigrants and war refugees who relocate to the first world countries experience. An immigrant is not a rare kind of person in the United States that was founded by the immigrants from Europe and then empowered and developed by the immigrants from all around the world. Yet, seeing such newcomer not many people actually wonder about their personal story, what forced them to move, what they left behind and what kind of life they faced after the relocation. Deo\u2019s life before the immigration was filled with horrors and sufferings, he witnessed a bloody and violent civil war that took his family from him. One may say that a young man fleeing his motherland in the middle of civil war is a coward, that he must stay and protect it. Yet, Deo chooses to protect his right granted by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that says \u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person\u201d (par. 12). The memories from the past are ever-present in his mind. When he first arrives to the USA he notices how different the people there are, that no one is scared or worried, that everyone is just doing their business or spends time with their families \u201cas if they didn\u2019t know there were places where dogs were trotting around with human heads in their mouths\u201d (Kidder 11). Deo notices other features he cannot explain. For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on. As a Burundian, Deo desperately tries to forget the sufferings of the past and forgive the perpetuators of his pain. Unfortunately, it is true",

Some people say that it is wrong to let drugs fall on the streets, as it could potentially cause many casualties and illegal drug addiction in the population. Others say, people should be able to decide why an individual becomes a drug user. These reasons indicate that drug policy in the USA should not be controlled by one single party. These issues have been cited as issues on why this drug war is failing.

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Pervasive humour is also known as grotesque humour, a style of writing in which the author mixes horror and humour for comic effect. Is \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d a horror story? Poe presents death as grotesque phenomena, yet in a humorous way to achieve comic relief. Through Montresor, the antagonistic, Poe presents death as a joke. He makes death seem like a funny occurrence from the beginning of the story to the end, which adds irony to the situation. Fortunato tells Montressor that he has a cog, but he wouldn\u2019t die of it, to which Montresor agrees joyously in the affirmative and goes on to encourage Fortunato to \u2018drink form draught of this Medoc\u2019 to cure his cough (Poe para 37). Montressor joyous affirmation is humorous, but the use of the term Medoc is horrific as the reader knows that Medoc, the wine already contains poison. Critics argue that Montresor, an unreliable narrator, uses these words not in any attempt to kill Fortunato but for his self-gratification. This means that Montresor finds joy and amusement in death.

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, however, is commonly used in food production to refer to a vessel. \u201cA cask\u201d is the food storage tank. On the other hand, cask in military and computing contexts denotes a large container held by machines such as the tank. Although \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d contains a cask, Montresor refers to the wine container by calling it Montresor\u2019s \u2018cask\u2019 (Poe para 17). This implies that he intends to fill the cask with wine to drink, but the situation turns dangerous when he intends to pour the wine only to drink the poison at once into his mouth, for Montresor drinks the wine only when it is poisoned, not when he drinks Fortunato\u2019s wine. A grave assumption is made that Montresor uses the concept of wine and wine making, i. e. the cask containing wine to imply that the poisonous wine he makes",

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",
