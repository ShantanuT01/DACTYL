The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

One disadvantage, however, is connected to the evaluation method used in different states. As pointed out in fact sheet released by National Governors Association (NGAA) the program includes multiple methods of evaluating the student results; this means that different evaluations have varying results, and parents and other concerned parties may disagree with each other regarding what constitutes quality teaching. Another concern associated with these grants are connected to the financial situation in many communities, as they lead to increasing levels of inflation due to additional school budget increases required by all regions (\u201cState Budget Balances Tightened Amid Growing Pledge to Help Schools.\u201d, n.d.). A key weakness connected to individualized education services is also related to increased requirements placed upon parents.

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

Yet, seeing such newcomer not many people actually wonder about their personal story, what forced them to move, what they left behind and what kind of life they faced after the relocation. Deo\u2019s life before the immigration was filled with horrors and sufferings, he witnessed a bloody and violent civil war that took his family from him. One may say that a young man fleeing his motherland in the middle of civil war is a coward, that he must stay and protect it. Yet, Deo chooses to protect his right granted by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that says \u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person\u201d (par. 12). The memories from the past are ever-present in his mind. When he first arrives to the USA he notices how different the people there are, that no one is scared or worried, that everyone is just doing their business or spends time with their families \u201cas if they didn\u2019t know there were places where dogs were trotting around with human heads in their mouths\u201d (Kidder 11). Deo notices other features he cannot explain. For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on. As a Burundian, Deo desperately tries to forget the sufferings of the past and forgive the perpetuators of his pain. Unfortunately, it is true",

To deal with such high rates of problem in the country, a significant shift is required in the policy approach, meaning new strategies have been developed (Rangelio & Pinto, 2008). New strategies include a decrease in imprisonment rate as well, and increase the number of court-ordered substance abuse testing services. Other important measures include offering full financial assistance and housing help through programs such as Substance Abuse Services Program and Treatment Act Program. It should also be stated that many American citizens continue abusing various drugs daily due to lack of education, social influences or mental problems, thus no substantial progress can occur until addressing these reasons, which is why any attempt should be undertaken for reducing people\u2019s reliance on certain",

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017).

        "text":"The use of horror and humor in \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d by Edgar Allan Poe is one of the literary features that the author uses to constructs the story. Poe is a manipulative author who uses linguistic techniques with so much ease and combines them with other literary devices such as the point of view, the setting and choice of words to add to the literary quality of his work. Poe can maintain a sense of pervasive humour throughout this short story as he combines horror and humour with so much ease. Pervasive humour is also known as grotesque humour, a style of writing in which the author mixes horror and humour for comic effect. Is \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d a horror story? Poe presents death as grotesque phenomena, yet in a humorous way to achieve comic relief. Through Montresor, the antagonistic, Poe presents death as a joke. He makes death seem like a funny occurrence from the beginning of the story to the end, which adds irony to the situation. Fortunato tells Montressor that he has a cog, but he wouldn\u2019t die of it, to which Montresor agrees joyously in the affirmative and goes on to encourage Fortunato to \u2018drink form draught of this Medoc\u2019 to cure his cough (Poe para 37). Montressor joyous affirmation is humorous, but the use of the term Medoc is horrific as the reader knows that Medoc, the wine already contains poison. Critics argue that Montresor, an unreliable narrator, uses these words not in any attempt to kill Fortunato but for his self-gratification. This means that Montresor finds joy and amusement in death. The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, however, sounds more horrible when compared with the name of the main character Montresor whose first name also seems quite inappropriate since the pronunciation of the character is almost hilarious. It\u2019s possible that Poe was influenced by the use of the names by another Englishman Thomas Montrose who had adopted Americanisation practices during his time of service abroad in order to avoid getting involved into political turmoil back home (\u201cGordon Para 6\u201d). On several occasions Poe creates ambiguity through the name \u201cMontressor\u201d as well; For example: \u201cMontresor\u2026\u201d says that he will come again in three years. It becomes evident now that \u201cMontre?\u201d stands out because its similarity to \u201cmonster,\u201d the title being used earlier, gives away Montresors true nature even though we cannot be sure what kind of monstrous personality the antagonist harbours. The word that Poe prefers is \u201cmont\u201d meaning wine which clearly establishes Montressors\u2019 true intention at",

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

Fundamentally, the social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories have contributed to distress among the people with STDs and increased the prevalence of preventable STDs such as HPV due to improper medications. First, the North American countries report high numbers of STDs annually. According to Reif et al.

(2019) revealed that female sex workers in 13 cities in Mexico had various STDs such as HIV\/AIDs and sexually transmitted infections. The gender equality that prevailed in Brazil as a major tourist center and the large demand for healthcare services prompted sex workers to seek treatment. Unfortunately, the same problem is observed in the world\u2019s greatest tourist destinations such as the United States of America, China, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Germany, among others. In these countries, sex workers do not have equal treatment, and the rate of demand for STD treatment lags, leaving STIs and other STDs among them. Second, different races have more STDs and difficulties in accepting these conditions as a result. According to Travaglini et al.

The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation.

Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

Deo\u2019s life before the immigration was filled with horrors and sufferings, he witnessed a bloody and violent civil war that took his family from him. One may say that a young man fleeing his motherland in the middle of civil war is a coward, that he must stay and protect it. Yet, Deo chooses to protect his right granted by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that says \u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person\u201d (par. 12). The memories from the past are ever-present in his mind.

Deo notices other features he cannot explain. For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on. As a Burundian, Deo desperately tries to forget the sufferings of the past and forgive the perpetuators of his pain. Unfortunately, it is true",

Some people say that it is wrong to let drugs fall on the streets, as it could potentially cause many casualties and illegal drug addiction in the population. Others say, people should be able to decide why an individual becomes a drug user. These reasons indicate that drug policy in the USA should not be controlled by one single party.

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017).

Upon completing his studies, he was posted at a children\u2019s hospital in Paddington Green, London in 1923. (Winnicott, 1960). The same year, he wed and also initiated a personality analysis with James Strachey, who happened to have been Freud\u2019s English translator. Four years later, he joined psychotherapists at a children\u2019s psychological institute, at the age of 31 (Winnicott, 1960). The study of Anna Freud (the daughter of Sigmund Freud) at 1 and 3 Kensington was also initiated in 1949, and Winnicott was appointed Professor of Applied Clinical Psychology by 1959, where other prominent figures in psychotherapy such as Erik Erikson joined to carry on the work in the subject\u2019s name (Winnicott, 1960).

Four years later, he joined psycho-analytical society of England, eventually qualifying in 1935, as a child analyst (Winnicott, 1969). Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria. She was also a qualified child psychology. Owing to these two factions of child psychologists, the psycho-analytical society of Britain was at this time faced with an imminent collapse. However, they were later to reach a compromise when the Second World War came to an end in 1945. This was made possible by way of the establishment of a middle group. It is this third group that Winnicott later identified with (Winnicott, 1996). Winnicott, through his numerous interactions with the children, reflected on the p",

This term, however, is commonly used in food production to refer to a vessel. \u201cA cask\u201d is the food storage tank. On the other hand, cask in military and computing contexts denotes a large container held by machines such as the tank. Although \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d contains a cask, Montresor refers to the wine container by calling it Montresor\u2019s \u2018cask\u2019 (Poe para 17). This implies that he intends to fill the cask with wine to drink, but the situation turns dangerous when he intends to pour the wine only to drink the poison at once into his mouth, for Montresor drinks the wine only when it is poisoned, not when he drinks Fortunato\u2019s wine. A grave assumption is made that Montresor uses the concept of wine and wine making, i. e. the cask containing wine to imply that the poisonous wine he makes",

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

(2019) revealed that female sex workers in 13 cities in Mexico had various STDs such as HIV\/AIDs, syphilis, and hepatitis C, which resulted in higher rates of HIV infection than any other sex worker in the country. Moreover, it is essential to note that most cases of STDs are not only acquired within sexual relationships but also through contact with bodily fluids such as blood. However, the most significant factor contributing to the spread of STDs among North Americans is the lack of awareness and education concerning STDs among the general population. In fact, most individuals do not realize the risk of contracting STDs from partners they are having intercourse with. For instance, 1 in 11 women in the US were infected with HIV in 2017 (Patterson et al., 2019). Therefore, the lack of awareness about the importance of safe sex practices and condom use leads to many STDs. It is imperative to note that there exist both medical and behavioral factors associated with the rise of STDs. For example",

The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

For example, if a state is not in compliance with the requirements of ESSA, it will have the right to apply the waiver provision under Title I of the federal law. Moreover, if states fail to implement standardized assessments, they will be able to opt out from this requirement (Sagin, 2016). Finally, if any state fails to meet the accountability standards, the state will lose its eligibility to receive additional funds.

The contract entailed constructing the UAE\u2019s first nuclear power plant in Barakah, more than 300 Kilometers from the capital Abu Dhabi. The flagship project and the construction of the first reactor of the four scheduled reactors began in 2011. The scheme is scheduled to be operational in 2017. The construction of the second reactor began in 2013. It is expected to be accomplished in 2018 (Dincer and Rosen 11). The construction of the remaining two reactors has already commenced and will be concluded in 2019 and 2020 respectively (Darwish and Mohtar 109). The capacity of the four reactors is expected to reach 5.6GW, which will play a critical role in supporting the country\u2019s increasing demand for energy. Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

A theme is defined as a group of words or concepts used to identify something particular in an article. It is composed of several words, but each word carries meaning within the given context (Brun, 2014). In other words, a theme consists of different meanings connected by a thread of meaning and is formed through relationships between various elements. Thematic codes are related to themes. They involve all the words included in a certain phrase or line, which form a whole group of ideas (Brun, 2014). For instance, the following two phrases have different thematic codes: \u201cI am afraid of being sold for prostitution\u201d and \u201c",

The girl also describes some parts of the network that serves as the background of human trafficking in India. The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

Deo\u2019s life before the immigration was filled with horrors and sufferings, he witnessed a bloody and violent civil war that took his family from him. One may say that a young man fleeing his motherland in the middle of civil war is a coward, that he must stay and protect it. Yet, Deo chooses to protect his right granted by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that says \u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person\u201d (par. 12). The memories from the past are ever-present in his mind.

Deo notices other features he cannot explain. For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on. As a Burundian, Deo desperately tries to forget the sufferings of the past and forgive the perpetuators of his pain. Unfortunately, it is true",

Another problem associated with the balanced approach policy is the lack of support from law enforcement officials. This is a result of the policy being based on evidence-based policy-making which was initiated in the early nineties. However, there is also another issue that needs to be addressed, namely the failure to provide resources for addressing the drug problem among indigenous communities (Nadelmann, 2010). There is no significant effort made to assist Native Americans who are most affected by the war on drugs. As a result, they have high rates of incarceration, substance abuse, and crime (Lingard & McConville, 2008). Moreover, the police have not done much",

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

The largest Chinese forum Yishanghuiyou creates a great opportunity for global business exchanges, which improves the popularity of the website (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of competitors who are often trying to enter the market (Gereffi, 2004). Moreover, many suppliers are not reliable and cannot deliver the required products at a reasonable price. Alibaba also faces difficulties with competition from domestic companies like Pinduoduo, which have already managed to gain substantial success. Although the company tries to provide the best conditions for suppliers and customers, it still has no effective measures against the threat of cybercrime. Alibaba can also be threatened by an increasing competition from smaller and independent e-commerce companies. Despite these weaknesses, Alibaba is a large and profitable enterprise that makes up about 30% of China\u2019s total GDP. It is worth mentioning that Alibaba\u2019s growth was supported by an efficient financial system and",
        "source_text":"Alibaba Group is the largest and most famous e-commercial platform in China. Suppliers are mainly from China, but there are also exporters from Taiwan, India, Korea, Japan, and some other countries. Apart from the largest marketplace, Aliexpress, the company also includes the websites Taobao.com, Tmall.com, and Juhuasuan.com, which account for about 82 percent of the company\u2019s revenue (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). Having the largest turnover in the world, Alibaba is a global leader in sales. This paper aims to identify the existence of internal and external strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities for the Alibaba Group. A well-known brand is the main strength of the Alibaba Group. Fast growth, huge investments, and asset acquisitions stimulate the interest of the outside world in the company and its brand. Another advantage is that the company has a wide network of sellers and buyers, the growth of which is promoted by active promotion and advertising (Clark, 2018). Alibaba has a rather big customer base and a well-developed procedure of the information exchange. The largest Chinese forum Yishanghuiyou creates a great opportunity for global business exchanges, which improves the popularity of the website (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Four years later, he joined psycho-analytical society of England, eventually qualifying in 1935, as a child analyst (Winnicott, 1969). Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria. She was also a qualified child psychology. Owing to these two factions of child psychologists, the psycho-analytical society of Britain was at this time faced with an imminent collapse. However, they were later to reach a compromise when the Second World War came to an end in 1945. This was made possible by way of the establishment of a middle group. It is this third group that Winnicott later identified with (Winnicott, 1996). Winnicott, through his numerous interactions with the children, reflected on the p",

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, although having some meaning to Fortunato and others, becomes humorous in the context of the title when it is used in conjunction with \u2018Amontillado\u2019, a type of fine Spanish wine. By using this term, the author makes a mockery of the drink. He says that Fortunato will have to drink form this medoc and that it will help him cure his cough. In this case, Fortunato drinks the wine and immediately falls ill. It would be ridiculous to expect him to recover if the wine contained poison. Poe\u2019s use of horror and humour is another feature that contributes to the literary quality of the short story.

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

However, the acceptance of the act is not uniform, with some experts pointing to potential gaps in the reform. The current paper aims at analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the learning and assessment process using a SWOT framework and providing the rationale for the identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Analysis The strongest regulatory advantage of the new act is the increased flexibility of the new system where federal authority has limited opportunity to hold schools accountable for achievement (Understood.org, n.d.). The federal government also cannot influence the adoption of common core state standards. Such a shift of authority enables localized decision-making and grants the possibility to adjust the educational programs to the needs of specific demographics. However, the wording of the act leaves some loopholes that introduce limited federal authority, such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that is approved on a federal level and is used to determine the technical education standards (Truth in American Education, 2015). It should also be mentioned that the transparency of the act\u2019s adoption lacks the necessary transparency to the point where it must be adopted before appropriate scrutiny can be applied (Wong, 2015). The economic aspect of the program is also subject to controversy. The introduction of the preschool development grants opens up significant opportunities for the population segment that lacked resources to actualize the potential of their children. Increased funding is also beneficial for the literacy educational grant pro",

The market share currently being occupied by imported fuels in relation to domestic fuels stood low since some other players like Japan adopted the locally manufactured ones; however, their influence continued for quite an extended period due to competition amongst local manufacturers.

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

On another hand, a successful state controlled way of controlling drugs was presented as a positive outcome from Governor Mike Lee\u2019s tough stance on cocaine trafficking along his Texas borders with Mexico since he believed drugs could make many people dependent, therefore making them vulnerable and thus criminalizable (Simpson, & Jones, p. 45).

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

Subsequent fighting among rival faction leaders resulted in the killing, dislocation, and starvation of thousands of Somalis and led the United Nations to intervene militarily in 1992. In 1992, responding to the political chaos and humanitarian disaster in Somalia, the United States and other nations launched peacekeeping operations to create an environment in which assistance could be delivered to the Somali people. By March 1993, the potential for mass starvation in Somalia had been overcome owing to a US-AID-led operation involving food distributions and delivery to poor refugee camps outside their traditional areas where supplies were readily available because famine had been alleviated due to UN presence; international help had enabled saving millions. However after some three years the peace negotiations between these two groups took effect on May11-14,2016 when at least twenty-four armswielders\u2019 corpses have come down dead.The next few days saw bloody killings between Somali warlords like Mohamud Guelleid of Burji, as well as local fighters from various armed factions within those communities who claimed allegiance only to one party, over disputes about land, resource distribution (\u201cSomali rebel leader kills 24 soldiers\u201d, April25,20), military defeat or",

While parts of the north are relatively peaceful, including much of the self-declared \u201cRepublic of Somaliland,\u201d interclan and interfactional fighting can flare up with little warning, and kidnapping, murder and other threats to foreigners can occur unpredictably in many regions. The Somali Republic gained independence on July 1, 1960. Somalia was formed by the union of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland, while French Somaliland became Djibouti. A socialist state was established following a coup led by Major General Muhammad Siad Barre. Rebel forces ousted the Barre regime in 1991, but turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy ensued. The Somali National Movement (SNM) gained control of the north, while in the capital of Mogadishu and most of southern Somalia the United Somali Congress achieved control.

By March 1993, the potential for mass starvation in Somalia had been overcome, but the security situation remained fragile. On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia. As of early October 20063, no AU or IGAD peacekeepers were scheduled to intervene. In May 2006, heavy fighting broke out in Mogadishu bet",

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria. She was also a qualified child psychology. Owing to these two factions of child psychologists, the psycho-analytical society of Britain was at this time faced with an imminent collapse. However, they were later to reach a compromise when the Second World War came to an end in 1945. This was made possible by way of the establishment of a middle group. It is this third group that Winnicott later identified with (Winnicott, 1996). Winnicott, through his numerous interactions with the children, reflected on the p",

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

It is essential to note that these two populations exhibit similar characteristics when it comes to behaviors such as risky sexual activities. Therefore, the existing rates should not be ignored, but rather addressed through public awareness campaigns aimed at changing the perceptions towards those affected populations. Second, although many people living in North American communities experience symptoms associated with various STDs without seeking medical attention regularly; however, there exist certain issues related to healthcare provision for patients with STDs. In this case, it can be argued that the lack of adequate healthcare resources for those with STDs in Canada makes it more challenging for people to access proper care during critical periods such as pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding.

For instance, Canada reported a 49.3% increase in chlamydia infection from 2005 to 2014, with the highest cases recorded among males (Logie et al., 2018). Similarly, the United States, among other North American sovereign nations and dependencies, records considerable numbers of STDs annually. Sadly, the existence of different races such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asians, among others, has led to misconceived notions about individuals with STIs, making it hard for them to accept their conditions. Fundamentally, the social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories have contributed to distress among the people with STDs and increased the prevalence of preventable STDs such as HPV due to improper medications. First, the North American countries report high numbers of STDs annually. According to Reif et al. (2019), about 19 million new cases of STIs occur yearly in the United States, costing approximately $10-17 billion dollars. Indeed, the prevalence of STDs continues to increase among young adults and adolescents in the USA. Similarly, Mexico also experiences an escalation of various STIs, including HIV\/AIDs, mainly due to the augmented sex workers\u2019 trade. A study by Patterson et al. (2019) revealed that female sex workers in 13 cities in Mexico had various STDs such as HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia, with the latter having the highest percentage of 15.3. The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

The introduction of the preschool development grants opens up significant opportunities for the population segment that lacked resources to actualize the potential of their children. Increased funding is also beneficial for the literacy educational grant proponent because this fund supports the improvement of reading skills and general knowledge among students (Bennett & Pinnock-Brook, 2008). In addition, these programs help in promoting cultural diversity through the use of English language acquisition activities designed specifically for immigrant families (Khan et al., 2014). This implies that while the initial costs might be high, the benefits associated with the implementation of programs are long-term. One weakness of ESSA includes insufficient attention paid by the authorities towards student outcomes when they do assess the performance of students (Duffield et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2014). Additionally, one should admit that there was an excessive focus put upon the national test score instead of assessing the abilities of teachers who could contribute to developing effective instructional practices.

According to the official website, the airport would have enough capacity for 100 million passengers annually. It is worth noting, however, that there are concerns over safety issues due to security threats facing both Turkey and Pakistan countries (Gardner & Tavishnik 13).

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

Two major tools used to analyze these data were open-ended interviews, observation techniques based on video recording, focus groups conducted with other members of society who have encountered human trafficking cases, and literature review to supplement information gathered during field research. Some key findings revealed by analyzing the given material show how much evidence exists for considering the above factors related to gender roles among women who live in poverty. A lot of time was spent observing behavior patterns exhibited by both male and female sex slaves in relation to each other.

The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

A clear indication that this policy has failed, is the fact that, despite utilizing large amounts of money to control drugs, the situation keeps worsening. It was observed that half of all federal prisoners in the USA by 2011 were drug convicts. Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan, 2010). According to the American Medical Association (AMA), since 1995, at least four people have died from overdoses due to opioids prescribed during their hospitalization (Munoz, 2008). On a related note, it is also important to mention that about seven million people die every year as a result of overusing narcotics or other illicit drugs in the country. These figures demonstrate how ineffective the current drug policies are in addressing the problem. Furthermore, it could be argued that the drug wars do little good to individuals who consume drugs in moderation. As noted earlier, the US government uses massive funds for fighting and treating narcotic addicts, yet they are not allowed into healthcare institutions. Moreover, most patients with addictive",
        "source_text":"Abstract The USA coast has been proactive in the war against drugs. This can be indicated by the confiscation of more than three tones of drugs, meant to be shipped to the USA, in July, 2012. However, there are still some criticisms regarding drug policy in the USA; that the US government has not done enough in this war. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the drug war in the US, citing possible achievement and failures, and looking for solutions to problems identified. Main Body There is an argument that the balanced approach policy to drug war is not effective. In fact, the balanced approach policy is criticized for not providing sufficient measures to overcome drug use in the US (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). The critics of this policy argue that the government is using more resources to control drugs, while only using few resources in drug victims\u2019 treatment and rehabilitation. For example, the government used 31 billion US dollars to fight drugs in 2009, and used only 10 billion for treatment (Preston, 2004). A clear indication that this policy has failed, is the fact that, despite utilizing large amounts of money to control drugs, the situation keeps worsening. It was observed that half of all federal prisoners in the USA by 2011 were drug convicts. Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

By March 1993, the potential for mass starvation in Somalia had been overcome, but the security situation remained fragile. On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia. As of early October 20063, no AU or IGAD peacekeepers were scheduled to intervene. In May 2006, heavy fighting broke out in Mogadishu bet",

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Four years later, he joined psycho-analytical society of England, eventually qualifying in 1935, as a child analyst (Winnicott, 1969). Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria. She was also a qualified child psychology. Owing to these two factions of child psychologists, the psycho-analytical society of Britain was at this time faced with an imminent collapse.

In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

Fundamentally, the social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories have contributed to distress among the people with STDs and increased the prevalence of preventable STDs such as HPV due to improper medications. First, the North American countries report high numbers of STDs annually. According to Reif et al.

Furthermore, the study showed that the rates of STIs among sex workers were higher than those reported among the general population. Second, the North American countries report high numbers of STDs. Indeed, in Canada, the STD prevalence rate was 15.5% in 2016, according to Logie et al. (2018). The same year, there was a 16.1% prevalence of chlamydia among Canadian women aged between 20 and 29 years. Consequently, chlamydia is among the most common STDs in Canada. In the US, approximately 2.7% of the female population has contracted chlamydia, and it is also the most common STD (Reif et al., 2019). Similarly, according to Reif et al.

The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

The introduction of the preschool development grants opens up significant opportunities for the population segment that lacked resources to actualize the potential of their children. Increased funding is also beneficial for the literacy educational grant proponent (FSA) who has an additional revenue source. This allows the FSA to provide more targeted financial support for the students and educators, which in turn could increase the effectiveness of the program. However, this is only possible if sufficient funding is allocated for the program. One of the main disadvantages of the act is that it is not a complete substitute for the current system. While it is necessary to implement a new system that will improve the quality of education, the act cannot replace the current system that is currently under scrutiny and review. Another disadvantage is that the program has several gaps, for instance, it does not address the issue of English language learners. In addition, the program does not allow the use of the local and state governments\u2019 budgets to fund the program. As a result, the program is dependent on federal grants, which are less stable than the state grants. Opportunities There are two main opportunities in the reform: the adoption",

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

Yet, seeing such newcomer not many people actually wonder about their personal story, what forced them to move, what they left behind and what they want to achieve here. This question is one that Tracy Kidder tries to answer through the story of his protagonist Deo. Deo, the civil war refugee from Burundi, does not want to leave behind his homeland and his loved ones. He wants to see his home country again but, due to the political situation in the country and the economic situation that is far worse than the one in Africa, he has no choice but to leave. Kidder, through Deo\u2019s character, tells the reader how it feels to have no choice but to leave something that one loves to leave. As the author states, \u201cthe things that I loved most about Burundi are the mountains that towered above me\u201d (Kidder 6). The author demonstrates that the protagonist had to leave behind not only the country but also his loved ones. \u201cI miss them,\u201d he",
        "source_text":"The modern world is full of drastic and often shocking contrasts. Poverty exists along with the excessive wealth, problems of the first and third world societies focus on very different issues, peaceful and safe environments may be located across the border from the ones torn apart by conflicts, distress and crises. In his novel titled Strength in What Remains Tracy Kidder provides an excellent demonstration of the unbelievable differences between the societies located in different parts of the world. Kidder\u2019s protagonist Deo is the one through whose eyes the readers get to observe the contrasting environments that are compared to different planets. The author brings up a theme of a civil war refugee who has fled to the United States from Africa and who struggles trying to match his old experiences to the new ones and to get used to the new life that is so much different from and sometimes even opposite to everything he knew. Tracy Kidder\u2019s non-fiction narrative about pre- and post-immigration experiences of Deo, a civil war refugee from Burundi, restores my faith in humanity in terms of three different aspects \u2013 the faith in an individual, the faith in a society, and the faith into a reader of this story. The Faith in an Individual The main protagonist of Strength in What Remains , Deo can be described as a hero of our time. His story is a detailed demonstration of what kind of cultural and emotional shock immigrants and war refugees who relocate to the first world countries experience. An immigrant is not a rare kind of person in the United States that was founded by the immigrants from Europe and then empowered and developed by the immigrants from all around the world. Yet, seeing such newcomer not many people actually wonder about their personal story, what forced them to move, what they left behind and what kind of life they faced after the relocation. Deo\u2019s life before the immigration was filled with horrors and sufferings, he witnessed a bloody and violent civil war that took his family from him. One may say that a young man fleeing his motherland in the middle of civil war is a coward, that he must stay and protect it. Yet, Deo chooses to protect his right granted by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that says \u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person\u201d (par. 12). The memories from the past are ever-present in his mind. When he first arrives to the USA he notices how different the people there are, that no one is scared or worried, that everyone is just doing their business or spends time with their families \u201cas if they didn\u2019t know there were places where dogs were trotting around with human heads in their mouths\u201d (Kidder 11). Deo notices other features he cannot explain. For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on. As a Burundian, Deo desperately tries to forget the sufferings of the past and forgive the perpetuators of his pain. Unfortunately, it is true",

In the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy, the government is actively pursuing drug dealers who sell or manufacture drugs in public places, such as shopping malls or airports (Preston, 2004). However, it is argued that the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy is not efficient because it does not provide effective measures to address drug abuse and addiction.

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

By March 1993, the potential for mass starvation in Somalia had been overcome, but the security situation remained fragile. On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Four years later, he joined psycho-analytical society of England, eventually qualifying in 1935, as a child analyst (Winnicott, 1969). Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria.

Critics argue that Montresor, an unreliable narrator, uses these words not in any attempt to kill Fortunato but for his self-gratification. This means that Montresor finds joy and amusement in death. The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

Fundamentally, the social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories have contributed to distress among the people with STDs and increased the prevalence of preventable STDs such as HPV due to improper medications.

The most significant causes of the spread of STIs in Mexico include sexual behavior patterns and risky behaviors, lack of access to STD treatment, poor health care systems, as well as inadequate economic empowerment of women (Patterson et al., 2019). It is vital to acknowledge that despite the increased prevalence of STIs, many STD cases are still unnoticed and go untreated in the USA. According to Logie et al. (2018), approximately 23.2 million STD cases occurred annually in the USA, while only 14.7 million were treated (Logie et al., 2018). Similarly, it is evident that many cases remain unnoticed because of inadequate public awareness, fear of stigmatization, lack of healthcare resources, as well as inadequate financial support. Therefore, there is an urgent need to promote public awareness campaigns that target various age groups and include sex workers",

(2019) revealed that female sex workers in 13 cities in Mexico had various STDs such as HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia, with the latter having the highest percentage of 15.3. The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

The introduction of the preschool development grants opens up significant opportunities for the population segment that lacked resources to actualize the potential of their children. Increased funding is also beneficial for the literacy educational grant proponent, who was expected to provide more than 50% of the federal grants. The lack of federal control on how the programs should be utilized has negative consequences. The failure to provide clear guidelines has been blamed for misappropriation of federal funds by some states (Noble, 2015). On the other hand, the act is expected to increase transparency in the way educational funding is used (Kopko, 2014). Another strength of the act is the improvement of student assessments. There are many educational assessment instruments available and some of them can be applied in an efficient manner, which makes the use of assessments in the evaluation of students\u2019 performance reasonable. Furthermore, the inclusion of the assessment process in the act increases the awareness of teachers and students about the importance of accurate information in making informed decisions (Wong, 2015).

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation.

Two major tools used to enhance the current research is social networks analysis (SNA) and social cognitive theory. SNA is applied to understand how the girls and women are linked within the criminal network, which is a powerful mechanism to control the victims. According to this approach, social interactions and communication among the members of the group play a key role in organizing the human trafficking process (Katz & Kastner, 2012). On the other hand, social cognitive theory helps the social worker to understand how the members of the group make decisions based on information they receive from each other. It is important to mention that this approach is focused on social interactions and is regarded as more useful when the social network is large and diverse.",
        "source_text":"Social Work Discussion Human trafficking can be regarded as an endemic social issue characterized by power, violence, and abuse. Women are common victims of this social vice, and social work is regarded as one of the tools to help the people affected by this crime to return to their normal lives. It has been acknowledged that social workers should employ theoretical paradigms to make their services focused and effective (Brun, 2014). Many theories exist to address the matter. One of the theoretical frameworks is trauma theory that focuses on the traumatic experiences victims are exposed to as well as the influence of these traumas on their further life (Usman, 2014). This theory is used to guide the analysis of a particular case involving a young Indian woman. This paper includes a brief discussion of the themes arising from the woman\u2019s account as well as the way these themes can enrich the current knowledge base and theory. The conventional content analysis was implemented to identify the most recurrent themes that include money, abuse, pregnancy, betrayal, violence, intimidation, stigmatization, and organized crime. The girl continuously mentions specific sums of money associated with human trafficking and focuses on such experiences as beating, torture, sexual violence. The girl also describes some parts of the network that serves as the background of human trafficking in India. The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on.

In addition, the US is a large country, with more than 330 million people. Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that the government will not fail in its attempts to fight drugs. In order to find ways of dealing with this problem, the balanced approach policy must be reviewed, as well as its effects on the economy and politics.

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017).

Four years later, he joined psychoanalytic school at Freudian Institute in London. During this period, he continued to analyze his own patients. His interest in personality development took shape after a series of cases, which involved a young boy, named Harry, whose father had died in a plane crash while on a vacation. He was the only child, and Harry suffered from various behavioral problems, which made him unable to go to school. Winnicott used this case to explore the problem of aggression, where he saw it to be a way of protecting one\u2019s feelings, rather than expressing anger. He then began to use various approaches in order to treat this behavior and other similar issues in his patients. In addition, the development of Winnicott\u2019s theory of transitional objects helped him understand the process of change, particularly in the child stage. His views of the nature of childhood as a place of \u201ccoping with stress\u201d, and the use of a child\u2019s ego as a tool for",

Four years later, he joined psycho-analytical society of England, eventually qualifying in 1935, as a child analyst (Winnicott, 1969). Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria. She was also a qualified child psychology. Owing to these two factions of child psychologists, the psycho-analytical society of Britain was at this time faced with an imminent collapse. However, they were later to reach a compromise when the Second World War came to an end in 1945. This was made possible by way of the establishment of a middle group. It is this third group that Winnicott later identified with (Winnicott, 1996). Winnicott, through his numerous interactions with the children, reflected on the p",

This term, cask is used to denote a vessel, but in this case, Poe gives it a gruesome meaning. The fact that Montresor uses this word to refer to wine indicates that he has already decided that death should be humorous. Death is not considered funny by Montresor as he has decided to drink from a cask of poison to make it even more funny.

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

(2018), stigma acts as a significant barrier to the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in North America. The most common STDs in the region are chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For instance, Canada reported a 49.3% increase in chlamydia infection from 2005 to 2014, with the highest cases recorded among males (Logie et al., 2018).

Secondly, despite being considered one of the least affected regions globally, Africa is currently facing numerous challenges related to sexual health issues. In fact, according to Ogbuohara & Odunsiyiwo (2020), there was no reliable data on STD rates between 1997 and 2016 within Nigeria. As indicated earlier, HIV\/ AIDS remains prevalent throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, there is an increasing number of new cases every year. Moreover, there were only three primary modes of transmission identified: heterosexual contact; mother-to-child transmission through breastfeeding; and injection drug use. However, injecting drugs pose the greatest risk since they lead to the direct exchange of blood products containing infectious agents. Thirdly, even though these two areas face problems concerning sexuality, gender inequality persists across both continents. On average",

The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

Increased funding is also beneficial for the literacy educational grant proponent because they are likely to increase investment due to the fact that more funds will go into the local communities. Additionally, this act provides an avenue through which states may expand their early childhood services or provide additional support to those who already have them (Sorrell & Burrell, 2008). There are several risks associated with implementing ESSA. First, there might arise resistance from parents whose child does not meet certain academic requirements; therefore, students would fail the standardized test without proper explanation. Secondly, educators\u2019 training and professional development need improvement since many teachers lack adequate knowledge about how to teach the new curriculum effectively (Goulden et al., 2020). Finally, it could lead to changes in teacher workloads resulting in decreased productivity among teachers.

In addition, it should note that there are plans to construct an additional unit for the fourth stage, known as Generation IV technology. This will increase the capacity of the existing facility to about five hundred megawatts when completed (Hassan et al. p.2; Dincer & Rosen pp.13-14). Despite these developments, some critics have raised concerns over safety issues associated with this ambitious undertaking. For instance, they argue that such projects pose serious risks due to the fact that their components include highly radioactive materials like uranium. Moreover, since most of them do not meet environmental standards set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the risk posed to public health could become very high if left unchecked (Nash 19). As mentioned earlier, the proposed generation",
        "source_text":"Company Description Through a declaration, President Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan inaugurated the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) in 2009. The core mandate of the corporation entails implementing a program for nuclear energy with the goal of producing safe and clean energy to aid in economic development of all UAE people (ENEC par.1). The inauguration of the corporation was appropriate, considering that the UAE energy requirement increases at the rate of almost 10%, which is roughly four times the international standard. The corporation is responsible for overseeing prime contractors\u2019 work in all stages of operation. It also ensures the development of human resource capability in the management of nuclear energy programs across the UAE. The company educates people on the nuclear energy program while providing information on the progress of the project implementation process (ENEC par.3). It forms the arm through which the Abu Dhabi government invests in the nuclear energy sector. While executing its mandate, soon after the 2009 inauguration, the country\u2019s nuclear energy regulator, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) successfully awarded a USD20 billion bid to a coalition of companies led by the Korea Electric Power. The contract entailed constructing the UAE\u2019s first nuclear power plant in Barakah, more than 300 Kilometers from the capital Abu Dhabi. The flagship project and the construction of the first reactor of the four scheduled reactors began in 2011. The scheme is scheduled to be operational in 2017. The construction of the second reactor began in 2013. It is expected to be accomplished in 2018 (Dincer and Rosen 11). The construction of the remaining two reactors has already commenced and will be concluded in 2019 and 2020 respectively (Darwish and Mohtar 109). The capacity of the four reactors is expected to reach 5.6GW, which will play a critical role in supporting the country\u2019s increasing demand for energy. Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

In terms of gender role, it became evident that women have no equal opportunities for employment or education due to discrimination based on race. Therefore, they often end up being exploited since there is little control over them while men enjoy more rights than women do (Kumar & Bhatia, 2008). Another tool included in the investigation involved analyzing the narratives through which the narrator tries to explain her past experience using various metaphors.

The girl also describes some parts of the network that serves as the background of human trafficking in India. The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on.

As a result, many people continue with their addiction without getting proper care or support from authorities. Another criticism about this policy is its lack of addressing other social issues like poverty and unemployment which contribute significantly to crime rates. Poverty reduces one\u2019s chances of engaging into criminal activities because they do not have any financial stability. Unemployment also contributes much towards higher levels of crimes as individuals become desperate due to low income. These two factors reduce the number of arrests but increase the rate at which criminals go free. Also, if we look back to the early days when the first anti-drug laws were enacted in America, most Americans did not want to engage in illegal substance trade. They wanted to avoid being involved",

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of suppliers who produce similar goods at low prices. In addition, this situation makes it difficult to find new products or services due to the lack of innovation and quality control measures (Clark, 2018; Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As a result, the supply chain becomes less efficient because all customers have equal access to cheaper alternatives. Moreover, competition among local companies increases pressure on foreign businesses. One major threat facing Alibaba Group is the increasing number of competitors with their own online platforms. For example, JD.com launched an international site under the name Jiajiao.com, which competes directly with Alibaba. Other players like Pinduoduo, Meituan Dianping, and Ant Financial offer",

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Four years later, he joined psycho-analytical society of England, eventually qualifying in 1935, as a child analyst (Winnicott, 1969). Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria. She was also a qualified child psychology. Owing to these two factions of child psychologists, the psycho-analytical society of Britain was at this time faced with an imminent collapse. However, they were later to reach a compromise when the Second World War came to an end in 1945. This was made possible by way of the establishment of a middle group. It is this third group that Winnicott later identified with (Winnicott, 1996). Winnicott, through his numerous interactions with the children, reflected on the p",

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, however, does not contain poison, making it harmless enough for consumption without fear of poisoning. However, there are two instances where the title seems to be horrific: when Montresor says that he will drown him into the cask; another instance occurs at the very end of the tale where Montresor drinks from the cask containing Fortunato\u2019s blood. It would have been better if the author had used more elaborate language to express his intent about drinking Fortunato\u2019s blood rather than saying directly through the narrative that he was going to drink it. Another example of horrifying wording is when Montresor says, \u201cFortuneo, I am afraid we shall never meet again.\u201d This statement shows that Montresor is concerned only about meeting Fortunato once before dying because they both died after being drunked to death.

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

It should also be mentioned that the transparency of the act\u2019s adoption lacks the necessary transparency to the point where it must be adopted before appropriate scrutiny can be applied (Wong, 2015). The economic aspect of the program is also subject to controversy. The introduction of the preschool development grants opens up significant opportunities for the population segment that lacked resources to actualize the potential of their children. Increased funding is also beneficial for the literacy educational grant programe which provides substantial benefits primarily due to targeted funding; therefore it does improve the academic progress and knowledge acquired by learners through improved teaching techniques coupled with enhanced materials (Friedenheimer et al., 2009) To counter this challenge associated from insufficient budget allocation dedicated solely toward supporting student achievements while reducing expenses connected within developing countries might seem impractical but could help alleviate underdeveloped communities. The ability of local governments have led to an advancement towards better services delivered to the students even though more funds would come to these districts than were already being utilized, which means all stakeholders will benefit when implemented properly The negative impacts included in this essay relate specifically in regards to those regions struggling to receive enough financial assistance. This region struggles financially because there are only so many public schools allocated funding per district without considering geographical limitations thus limiting growth throughout the entire country The increase caused lack support from the community leading to further decrease since they feel left behind The main issue",
        "source_text":"Introduction The current reform aimed at the replacement of the federally mandated Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including the passing of Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is aimed at the weaknesses of its predecessor \u2013 the No Child Left Behind Act. However, the acceptance of the act is not uniform, with some experts pointing to potential gaps in the reform. The current paper aims at analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the learning and assessment process using a SWOT framework and providing the rationale for the identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Analysis The strongest regulatory advantage of the new act is the increased flexibility of the new system where federal authority has limited opportunity to hold schools accountable for achievement (Understood.org, n.d.). The federal government also cannot influence the adoption of common core state standards. Such a shift of authority enables localized decision-making and grants the possibility to adjust the educational programs to the needs of specific demographics.

There have been allegations about safety issues relating especially the risk involved in accidents like Chernobyl nuclear accident due mainly to differences of culture between different nations including India where several large scale nuclear facilities are under operation. As such some people say it is not advisable taking risks related to health because there can be massive death consequences if an issue were experienced in the future. However since most nuclear plants around today follow proper safety regulations and best practices set forth in national laws regarding radiation protection so they reduce unnecessary hazards.

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

Deo notices other features he cannot explain. For example, he cannot comprehend why poor people can be overweight and rich ones are skinny, and why do the Westerners cling to their bad memories while the Burundians try to forget and move on.

Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

While parts of the north are relatively peaceful, including much of the self-declared \u201cRepublic of Somaliland,\u201d interclan and interfactional fighting can flare up with little warning, and kidnapping, murder and other threats to foreigners can occur unpredictably in many regions. The Somali Republic gained independence on July 1, 1960. Somalia was formed by the union of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland, while French Somaliland became Djibouti. A socialist state was established following a coup led by Major General Muhammad Siad Barre. Rebel forces ousted the Barre regime in 1991, but turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy ensued. The Somali National Movement (SNM) gained control of the north, while in the capital of Mogadishu and most of southern Somalia the United Somali Congress achieved control.

By March 1993, the potential for mass starvation in Somalia had been overcome, but the security situation remained fragile. On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia. As of early October 20063, no AU or IGAD peacekeepers were scheduled to intervene. In May 2006, heavy fighting broke out in Mogadishu bet",

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Four years later, he joined psycho-analytical society of England, eventually qualifying in 1935, as a child analyst (Winnicott, 1969). Through the years, Winnicott made numerous analyses related to child psychology, with the help of such child analysts as Melanie Klein and Joan Riviere. Winnicott shared with the Melanie Klein the belief that psychic health was indeed of paramount importance during the first year of the life of a child (Winnicott 1969). However, this same view was in sharp contrast to that shared by Freud\u2019s daughter, Anna had moved to London in 1938, following the persecution of the Nazis in Austria. She was also a qualified child psychology. Owing to these two factions of child psychologists, the psycho-analytical society of Britain was at this time faced with an imminent collapse. However, they were later to reach a compromise when the Second World War came to an end in 1945. This was made possible by way of the establishment of a middle group. It is this third group that Winnicott later identified with (Winnicott, 1996). Winnicott, through his numerous interactions with the children, reflected on the p",

The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",

It is important to note that although there was no evidence on whether women engage more frequently in unprotected sexual intercourse because they do not receive adequate education on contraception, research indicates that this could be one reason why females tend to experience higher incidences of STDs. In addition, according to Koss & Giammiotti (2020), the rate of adolescent pregnancy increases significantly if parents delay marriage until later ages. This means that many teenagers are pregnant at a relatively early age, which contributes to an increase in STDs since most of these pregnancies are associated with uncontrolled sex. Second, some regions like Latin America record low levels of awareness regarding STD prevention measures among its citizens. Therefore, despite efforts made to improve awareness programs in",
        "source_text":"The social stigma problem exists nearly in all parts of the world, including North America. According to Travaglini et al. (2018), stigma acts as a significant barrier to the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in North America. The most common STDs in the region are chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For instance, Canada reported a 49.3% increase in chlamydia infection from 2005 to 2014, with the highest cases recorded among males (Logie et al., 2018). Similarly, the United States, among other North American sovereign nations and dependencies, records considerable numbers of STDs annually. Sadly, the existence of different races such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asians, among others, has led to misconceived notions about individuals with STIs, making it hard for them to accept their conditions. Fundamentally, the social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories have contributed to distress among the people with STDs and increased the prevalence of preventable STDs such as HPV due to improper medications. First, the North American countries report high numbers of STDs annually. According to Reif et al. (2019), about 19 million new cases of STIs occur yearly in the United States, costing approximately $10-17 billion dollars. Indeed, the prevalence of STDs continues to increase among young adults and adolescents in the USA. Similarly, Mexico also experiences an escalation of various STIs, including HIV\/AIDs, mainly due to the augmented sex workers\u2019 trade. A study by Patterson et al. (2019) revealed that female sex workers in 13 cities in Mexico had various STDs such as HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia, with the latter having the highest percentage of 15.3. The findings also indicated that the prevalence rate varied across the Mexican municipalities based on the distribution of female sex workers. The situation is relatively the same in Canada and other dependent territories. These figures demonstrate the significance of the STIs problem in North America and the considerable harm social stigma could cause to the population. Consequently, there is a dire need to embrace people with STDs in the region to inspire them to access the appropriate medications to control the prevalence rate. Some primary factors cause social stigma in the North American countries and dependent territories. For instance, a study by Darlington and Hutson (2017) conducted in the major states of the United States demonstrated that people are often judgmental about sex. Such misconceived notions lead to unnecessary condemnation of individuals diagnosed with STIs. Indeed, the results highlighted that STD stigma is the worst shame experienced by North American residents. Individuals often react negatively to news of a person diagnosed with an STI. They stereotype such an individual as slutty or dirty and someone who engages in sex unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this perception is always hurting because many individuals get infected in different circumstances, which may be beyond their control, such as rape. As a result, people living with an STD feel insecure and fear losing their family members. Some individuals also become domestic violence victims due to daily scornful",

Therefore, the economic benefits are expected to increase the number of participants and improve the quality of education for them. The weakness of the ESSA lies in the lack of an adequate plan for the future. There was no consideration of the possible consequences of the reform when implementing it into practice or planning how to address issues like the financial constraints faced by many public institutions across America (Doros & Cusano, 2009). Additionally, the fact that the school districts do not have enough time to adapt to changes implies the lack of effective implementation strategies. The opportunity that the act provides for the participation of all stakeholders is positive since local governments, states, and even individual parents participate in making decisions regarding the reform.

Problem Statement and Problem Definition ENEC has already made a significant progress in providing clean and safe nuclear energy through the ongoing construction of nuclear plants. However, in the execution of its mandates as discussed in the background section, it is important for the company to identify and resolve some of internal and external problems that may hinder it from becoming technologically savvy. This paper proposes a solution to one of such problems. The problem is in the finance department, specifically the area of management accounting. The department utilizes a manual budgeting process. This problem reduces the speed of processing and analyzing budgetary accounting information. The speed of processing and analyzing accounting-related information is critical in making rapid decision during a project execution process and running it upon its full implementation. To solve this problem, ENEC needs to implement an account",

The girl also describes some parts of the network that serves as the background of human trafficking in India. The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to describe her experience were the concepts of victimhood and gender roles. As for the theme related to gender roles, it appears that the girl feels trapped into them due to circumstances beyond her control. The other crucial theme that needs consideration is stigma since she believes that women cannot participate in trade or engage in any kind of economic activity without being identified by society. In addition, the girl states that no one recognizes human trafficking cases properly, which implies that there may not be sufficient awareness about this problem among all stakeholders involved in it. Finally, she claims that organized crime makes her feel powerless because they do not respect anyone\u2019s rights even if they have the same status as her (Bryson & Smith, 200",

The network includes brothel workers, police officers, relatives, criminals who traffic girls. Two major tools used to control victims are intimidation and violence. The identified themes provide valuable insights into the problem of human trafficking and can contribute to the development of trauma theory. Stigmatization is an important phenomenon to be analyzed. According to the theory, victims turn back to the experiences they lived through and repeat impaired relationship patterns throughout their life. Ina\u2019s case reveals one of the influential factors affecting this process. The young woman is stigmatized in her village as even her close relatives (aunts and uncles still abuse her). She does not feel fit for the role of a mother, which is an illustration of impaired relationship patterns. In simple terms, the community creates the ground for the victim\u2019s issues associated with the development of certain relationships. Social workers should pay specific attention to this area and try to help victims cope with this issue. Victims should feel empowered and find the strengths to accept their past to move on and self-develop irrespective of some attitudes within their communities. It is necessary to note that the rest of the identified themes are similar to the ones discussed within the theoretical work mentioned above. Although the focus is on trauma, such issues as abuse, pregnancy, intimidation, violence, and power are also addressed (Usman, 2014). These are major factors that affect victims\u2019 psychological well-being. The credibility of the discussion is illustrated by the recurrence of the themes in the brief account of the girl. The same themes arise when similar cases are considered in terms of trauma theory. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the case in question can contribute to the development of trauma theo",

This can be indicated by the confiscation of more than three tones of drugs, meant to be shipped to the USA, in July, 2012. However, there are still some criticisms regarding drug policy in the USA; that the US government has not done enough in this war. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the drug war in the US, citing possible achievement and failures, and looking for solutions to problems identified. Main Body There is an argument that the balanced approach policy to drug war is not effective. In fact, the balanced approach policy is criticized for not providing sufficient measures to overcome drug use in the US (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). The critics of this policy argue that the government is using more resources to control drugs, while only using few resources in drug victims\u2019 treatment and rehabilitation. For example, the government used 31 billion US dollars to fight drugs in 2009, and used only 10 billion for treatment (Preston, 2004). A clear indication that this policy has failed, is the fact that, despite utilizing large amounts of money to control drugs, the situation keeps worsening.

Therefore, it is essential to analyze the drug war in the US, citing possible achievement and failures, and looking for solutions to problems identified. Main Body There is an argument that the balanced approach policy to drug war is not effective. In fact, the balanced approach policy is criticized for not providing sufficient measures to overcome drug use in the US (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). The critics of this policy argue that the government is using more resources to control drugs, while only using few resources in drug victims\u2019 treatment and rehabilitation. For example, the government used 31 billion US dollars to fight drugs in 2009, and used only 10 billion for treatment (Preston, 2004). A clear indication that this policy has failed, is the fact that, despite utilizing large amounts of money to control drugs, the situation keeps worsening. It was observed that half of all federal prisoners in the USA by 2011 were drug convicts. Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Furthermore, even though the number of people addicted to drugs is growing steadily, no significant change in the way drugs are controlled has occurred yet. This shows that the balanced approach to fighting drug wars might have led to failure because the focus shifted from the source of addiction, which leads to further escalation. As a result, instead of addressing the root cause of addiction, other issues like funding for drug rehab centers or support groups had taken over as priorities, thus leading to the problem\u2019s worsening (Meyerowitz & O\u2019Brien, 1987). To begin with, one should understand why America does not have a successful drug war policy. First of all, the US has a",

Thus, despite using billions of money to control drugs in previous years, drug access and use keeps increasing (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Therefore, the critics of the US drug policy point this as a sign of defeat. There is an agreement that war on drugs has failed. The conclusion was made considering the amount of money that has been used to control drugs in America in the last 40 years, coupled with the proliferation of drugs in this country; it is apparent that such resources have been going to waste (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). A point of the agreement is that the levels of drug abuse have continued to increase over the years, while the number of fatalities arising from a drug overdose has hit their peak (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug War Debate, 2012). Thus, the drug policy adopted by the USA is not effective at all. There are various arguments, which are perfectly agreeable, regarding the drug policy. First, the confiscation of drugs by state agencies is just a tip of the ice berg, since shows that more of such drugs pass unnoticed (Marcy, 2010). Therefore, such drug confiscations will have no effect in reducing drug abuse in the US, as there are still more channels that have not been discovered. Therefore, the best thing is to shift resources from drug control, and utilize them for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation (Preston, 2004). Another agreeable argument is that even though it may appear as if the amount used for treatment and prevention is less than that used in drug control, the case could be different. While the budget of drug control portrays all the resources applied towards drug control in all the country, treatment and prevention budget is much higher, since the same practices are being undertaken at the state level (Ethan Nadelmann on CNN: Drug",

On October 3, 1993 U.S. troops received significant causalities (19 dead over 80 others wounded) 2 in a battle with Somali gunmen. When the United States (in 1994) and the UN withdrew (in 1995) their forces from Somalia, after suffering significant casualties, order still had not been restored. Conflict between rival warlords and their factions continued throughout the 1990s. No stable government emerged to take control of the country. The UN assisted Somalia somewhat with food aid but did not send peacekeeping troops into the country. In the late 1990s, relative calm began to emerge and economic development accelerated somewhat. The country was by no means stable, but it was improving. A transitional government emerged in 2000 but soon lost power. Somaliland and Puntland, two regions in the north broke away from the country and set up regional, semi-autonomous governments. They are not internationally recognized. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States began to take a more active role in Somalia\u2019s affairs, fearing that the country had become a haven for terrorists. Other Western governments hoped to bring stability to Somalia for similar reasons. In January 2004, two dozen or so warlords reached a power-sharing agreement after talks in Kenya. This agreement called for a 275-member parliament. This Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the 14th attempt at a government since 1991. Its head, Abdullah Yusuf originally called for African peacekeepers to restore order within Somalia but many Somalis feared invasion, especially by nearby Ethiopia.

Information on the website is becoming more differentiated, comprehensive, targeted, and effective. Aside from its obvious advantages, Alibaba Group has several weaknesses such as the abundance of sellers. When Alibaba first appeared, there were more than 8 million vendors, and this number is growing rapidly (Qin, 2017). Alibaba does not have a limit of vendors who register to sell their products on the Chinese e-commerce market. This has led to a huge number of dealers competing in the online commercial platform. This is a big challenge for many sellers which makes them withdraw the agreement. Moreover, the majority of vendors are deprived of the opportunity to sell at beneficial prices. Alibaba Group has several threats that include the strengthening of state regulation and the growth of competitors. Increasing competition is the main risk. Although Alibaba is a market leader, the company is under pressure from a growing number of competitors, especially in the B2C segment. For example, JD.com shows rapid growth by offering lower prices and faster delivery (Wu & Gereffi, 2018). As for state regulation, most platform sellers are often non-residents of China, which allows them to avoid local taxation. There are currently no regulatory standards for small enterprises, but this omission may be eliminated in the future. Despite some threats, Alibaba has huge opportunities for further growth because of its well-developed base in the Chinese market and a good knowledge of e-commerce. The fast-growing cloud business is one of the main expectations for the future. Recently, there was significant growth in its income from cloud services. The total revenue of Alibaba Group increased almost twice in just one year (Qin, 2017). Taking into account this enormous rise and the increasing investments in research and design, Alibaba can successfully develop its cloud business in the future. It can",

Fortunato tells Montressor that he has a cog, but he wouldn\u2019t die of it, to which Montresor agrees joyously in the affirmative and goes on to encourage Fortunato to \u2018drink form draught of this Medoc\u2019 to cure his cough (Poe para 37). Montressor joyous affirmation is humorous, but the use of the term Medoc is horrific as the reader knows that Medoc, the wine already contains poison. Critics argue that Montresor, an unreliable narrator, uses these words not in any attempt to kill Fortunato but for his self-gratification. This means that Montresor finds joy and amusement in death. The title of the short story is also humorously horrific. The author uses the word cask to mean wine container or barrel. This term, cask, is obtained from the same root name as the casket, which means coffin. Montresor wants to avenge Fortunato\u2019s insult and thus devices a way to kill him. Therefore, he invites Fortunato to taste from the cask of Amontillado, Amontillado being the new wine. In the short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado, \u201d Poe\u2019s use of the term cask infers to the casket, the humorous way of referring to Fortunato\u2019s casket (coffin). Thus, the analysis shows that Fortunato is represented as a fool who falls for this joke, not knowing that it signifies his death. Poe combines this piece of humour with horror by using the term mason. Fortunato\u2019s questions Montresor whether he is a mason, meaning a member of the freemasons, to which Montresor agrees. In grotesque reference to death, Poe uses the term mason to mean a person who constructs using bricks to insinuate that Montresor will create Fortunato\u2019s grave with stone and mortar (Poe paras 60, 76, 89). The author also uses the name Fortunato to refer to the folly of this particular character humorously and to conceal the grotesque death that awaits him. As is clear from the summary, the name Fortunato is connected to the word fortunate, which means lucky or good fortune. The reader knows that Fortunato is not lucky as there is grotesque death that awaits him. As such, Poe uses this name to bring comic relief in a tense and gross situation. Fortunato\u2019s dressing apparel is also humorous and is used for the same purpose as his name Fortunato: to conceal the fate that awaits him (Poe para 4). He is d",
