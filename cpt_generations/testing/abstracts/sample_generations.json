We treat a conducting polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling.

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved.

For example the annulus sector for the short string contains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\\\"obius strip) of the long strings. The boundary\/cross-cap states of the short strings are classified into three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary and the cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection of two short strings. We show that the sum of the all possible boundary conditions is equal to the exponential of the sum of the irreducible amplitude -- one body amplitude of long open (closed) strings. This is typical structure of DLCQ partition function. We examined that the tadpole cancellation condition in our language and derived the well-known gauge group $SO(2^{13})$.",

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties.",

The JVLA data clearly show a radio structure in the first source, and a radio emission with a relatively steep radio spectrum in the second one, demonstrating the presence of a radio jet and a diffuse component. Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift.

In this work we present a theoretical analysis of electron transport in polymer nanofibers assuming them to be in conducting state. We treat a conducting polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling.

        "source_text":"In this paper on hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one space dimension, we give a complete picture of stability for all solutions to the Riemann problem which contain only extremal shocks. We study stability of the Riemann problem amongst a large class of solutions. We show stability among the family of solutions with shocks from any family. We assume solutions verify at least one entropy condition. We have no small data assumptions. The solutions we consider are bounded and satisfy a strong trace condition weaker than $BV_{\\text{loc}}$. We make only mild assumptions on the system. In particular, our work applies to gas dynamics, including the isentropic Euler system and the full Euler system for a polytropic gas. We use the theory of a-contraction (see Kang and Vasseur [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 222(1):343--391, 2016]), and introduce new ideas in this direction to allow for two shocks from different shock families to be controlled simultaneously. This paper shows $L^2$ stability for the Riemann problem for all time. Our results compare to Chen, Frid, and Li [Comm. Math. Phys., 228(2):201--217, 2002] and Chen and Li [J.

The outcome is, that shape coexistence may occur in certain islands on the nuclear map.

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

Using these facts, we investigate the evolution of the cosmological perturbation on superhorizon scales in the universe dominated by oscillating multiple scalar fields which are generally interacting with each other, and the ratio of whose masses is incommensurable. Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved. As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.

We find that half the CO (3-2) emission originates in the overlap region where most of the tidally induced star formation had been previously found in shorter wavelength images, with the rest being centered on each of the nuclei. The gross distribution is consistent with lower resolution single dish images, but we show for the first time the detailed distribution of the warm and dense molecular gas across this galaxy pair at resolutions comparable to the size of a typical giant molecular complex. While we find that 58% (33\/57) of the spatially resolved Giant Molecular Associations (GMAs; a few x 100 pc) are located in the overlap region, only \\leqq 30% spatially coincides with the optically detected star clusters, suggesting that the bulk of the CO (3-2) emission traces the regions with very recent or near future star formation activity. The spatial distribution of the CO (3-2)\/CO (1-0) integrated brightness temperature ratios mainly range between 0.3 and 0.8, which suggests that on average the CO (3-2) line in the Antennae is not completely thermalized and similar to the average values of nearby spirals. A higher ratio is seen in both nuclei and the southern complexes in the overlap region. Higher radiation field associated with intense star formation can account for the nucleus of NGC 4038 and the overlap region, but the nuclear region of NGC 4039 show relatively little star formation or AGN activities and cannot be easily explained. We show kinematical evidence that the high line ratio in NGC 4039 is possibly caused by gas inflow into the counter-rotating central disk.",

However, some universal behaviors are seen. For instance at low frequencies, real part of conductivity shows a delta function behavior while the imaginary part has a pole which means that these two parts are connected to each other through Kramers-Kronig relation.

We also find evidence for morphological segregation, as late-type galaxies appear to be distributed within haloes of mass scales corresponding to groups and clusters up to about two virial radii, while passive objects show a preference to reside closer to the halo centre.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation.

Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties.",

Two of them, SDSS J0100+2802 and SDSS J0306+1853 at redshift 6.326 and 5.363 respectively, are radio-quiet AGN according to the classic definition, while the third (B2 1023+25 at z=5.284) is a powerful blazar. The JVLA data clearly show a radio structure in the first source, and a radio emission with a relatively steep radio spectrum in the second one, demonstrating the presence of a radio jet and a diffuse component. Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift.

In this work we present a theoretical analysis of electron-transport characteristics for thin nanowires with cylindrical shape. We use linear chain approximation, considering an effective one-dimensional system where electrons can move through it without being restricted by boundary effects. For a fixed value of applied voltage, we obtain expressions for electron mobility as a function of the wire radius, wire length, number of layers and chirality of the polymer chain.

In this work we present a theoretical analysis of electron transport in polymer nanofibers assuming them to be in conducting state. We treat a conducting polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling. The temperature dependencies of the magnitudes of the peaks in the transmission corresponding to these new states are analyzed.",

It is supposed, that shape coexistence is activated by an intermediate transition between a shell-model and an extended configuration interaction type configuration function (ECI-CF). The influence of a new particle with large angular momentum on the transition is also discussed. A quantitative description of this phenomenon is achieved via calculations for nuclei in various energy regions and compared to available experimental data. This allows one to determine the size of the new particle. A detailed analysis shows that it is responsible for a pronounced enhancement of the neutron skin depth. These results are confirmed by the density functional",
        "source_text":"A novel dual-shell mechanism for the phenomenon of shape coexistence in nuclei within the Elliott SU(3) and the proxy-SU(3) symmetry is proposed for all mass regions. It is supposed, that shape coexistence is activated by large quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and involves the interchange among the spin-orbit (SO) like shells within nucleon numbers 6-14, 14-28, 28-50, 50-82, 82-126, 126-184, which are being described by the proxy-SU(3) symmetry, and the harmonic oscillator (HO) shells within nucleon numbers 2-8, 8-20, 20-40, 40-70, 70-112, 112-168 of the Elliott SU(3) symmetry. The outcome is, that shape coexistence may occur in certain islands on the nuclear map. The dual-shell mechanism predicts without any free parameters, that nuclei with proton number (Z) or neutron number (N) between 7-8, 17-20, 34-40, 59-70, 96-112, 146-168 are possible candidates for shape coexistence. In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved. As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.

However, some universal behaviors are seen. For instance at low frequencies, real part of conductivity shows a delta function behavior while the imaginary part has a pole which means that these two parts are connected to each other through Kramers-Kronig relation. The behavior of real part of conductivity in the large frequency regime can be achieved by $Re[\\sigma]=\\omega^{D-4}$.

It is shown that the topology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string in general do not coincide.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum.

The JVLA data clearly show a radio structure in the first source, and a radio emission with a relatively steep radio spectrum in the second one, demonstrating the presence of a radio jet and a diffuse component. Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift. The discovery of powerful relativistic jets associated with the most massive black holes in the early Universe re-opens the question: is the jet instrumental for a rapid growth of the black hole or instead is the black hole mass the main driver for the jet formation?",

Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers.

We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers.

Its dramatic rise and lack of fading over a six-year period hint that it may be similar to FU Ori outbursts, although the luminosity appears to be significantly smaller than the canonical luminosities of such objects.",

The discrepancy is about $4.8\\sigma$. The computation gives the first independent check for that value. A shift in the fine-structure constant prediction is revealed in the paper. The developed calculation method is based on (a) a subtraction procedure for removing all ultraviolet and infrared divergences in Feynman parametric space before integration; (b) a nonadaptive Monte Carlo integration that uses the probability density functions that are constructed for each Feynman graph individually using its combinatorial structure. The method is described briefly in the paper (with the corresponding references to the previous papers). The values for the contributions of nine gauge-invariant classes splitting the whole set are presented in the paper. Moreover, the whole set of all 5-loop graphs without lepton loops is split into 807 subsets for comparison (in the future) of the calculated values with the values obtained by another methods. These detailed results are presented in the supplemental materials. Also, the supplemental materials contain the contribution values for each of 3213 individual Feynman graphs.

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell.

Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved. As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.

Their apparent IR luminosities span $(0.1-3.1)\\times 10^{14} L_\\odot$ (median of $1.2\\times10^{14}L_\\odot$), making them some of the most luminous galaxies found so far. They are also some of the rarest objects in the sky with a source density of $\\lesssim0.01$ deg$^{-2}$. Our Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.1 mm continuum observations with $\\theta$ $\\approx$ 0.4\" resolution show clear ring or arc morphologies characteristic of strong lensing. Their lensing-corrected luminosity of $L_{\\rm IR}\\gtrsim 10^{13}L_\\odot$ ($SFR\\gtrsim10^3 M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) indicates that they are the magnified versions of the most intrinsically luminous DSFGs found at these redshifts. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis finds little detectable AGN activity despite their enormous luminosity, and any AGN activity present must be extremely heavily obscured.",

However, some universal behaviors are seen. For instance at low frequencies, real part of conductivity shows a delta function behavior while the imaginary part has a pole which means that these two parts are connected to each other through Kramers-Kronig relation.

Within the framework of our models, galaxies of both classes are found to be as spatially concentrated as the dark matter within haloes even though, while the distribution of star-forming galaxies can also allow for some steeper profiles, this is drastically ruled out in the case of early-type galaxies. We also find evidence for morphological segregation, as late-type galaxies appear to be distributed within haloes of mass scales corresponding to groups and clusters up to about two virial radii, while passive objects show a preference to reside closer to the halo centre.

We calculate the corresponding orbifold amplitudes from two viewpoints -- from the boundary state formalism and from the trace over the open string Hilbert space. It is shown that the topology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string in general do not coincide. For example the annulus sector for the short string contains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\\\"obius strip) of the long strings. The boundary\/cross-cap states of the short strings are classified into three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary and the cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection of two short strings. We show that the sum of the all possible boundary conditions is equal to the exponential of the sum of the irreducible amplitude -- one body amplitude of long open (closed) strings.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum.

These effects are studied in a fully relativistic mean field model which goes beyond the linear density approximation and also includes baryon resonances.

When $\\Gamma_T=0$, we find perfect equivalence between both one-body theory calculations as well its approximate calculation based on Fermi gas statistics.

These effects are studied in a fully relativistic mean field model which goes beyond the linear density approximation and also includes baryon resonances. In particular, the role of N*(1520) and N*(1720) on the rho meson spectral density is highlighted. Even though the nucleon-nucleon loop and the nucleon-resonance loop contribute with the opposite sign, an overall reduction of rho meson mass is still observed at high density. Importantly, it is shown that the resonances cause substantial broadening of the rho meson spectral density in matter and also induces non-trivial momentum dependence. The spectral density of the a0 meson is also shown. We study the dispersion relations and collective oscillations induced by the rho meson propagation in nuclear matter together with the influence of the mixing of rho with the a0 meson.

Two of them, SDSS J0100+2802 and SDSS J0306+1853 at redshift 6.326 and 5.363 respectively, are radio-quiet AGN according to the classic definition, while the third (B2 1023+25 at z=5.284) is a powerful blazar. The JVLA data clearly show a radio structure in the first source, and a radio emission with a relatively steep radio spectrum in the second one, demonstrating the presence of a radio jet and a diffuse component. Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift. The discovery of powerful relativistic jets associated with the most massive black holes in the early Universe re-opens the question: is the jet instrumental for a rapid growth of the black hole or instead is the black hole mass the main driver for the jet formation?",

        "source_text":"A new approach is suggested for the study of geometric symmetries in general relativity, leading to an invariant characterization of the evolutionary behaviour for a class of Spatially Homogeneous (SH) vacuum and orthogonal $\\gamma -$law perfect fluid models. Exploiting the 1+3 orthonormal frame formalism, we express the kinematical quantities of a generic symmetry using expansion-normalized variables. In this way, a specific symmetry assumption lead to geometric constraints that are combined with the associated integrability conditions, coming from the existence of the symmetry and the induced expansion-normalized form of the Einstein's Field Equations (EFE), to give a close set of compatibility equations. By specializing to the case of a \\emph{Kinematic Conformal Symmetry} (KCS), which is regarded as the direct generalization of the concept of self-similarity, we give the complete set of consistency equations for the whole SH dynamical state space. An interesting aspect of the analysis of the consistency equations is that, \\emph{at least} for class A models which are Locally Rotationally Symmetric or lying within the invariant subset satisfying $N_{\\alpha}^{\\alpha}=0 $, a proper KCS \\emph{always exists} and reduces to a self-similarity of the first or second kind at the asymptotic regimes, providing a way for the ``geometrization'' of the intermediate epoch of SH models.",

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur.

But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell.

We show that energy shifts are possible due to a coupling between different rings as well as among the two interacting nanostructures via interfacial interactions which leads to a novel regime with extremely long lifetime of both optical excitation and transport channels, even at relatively short interaction lengths such as on subwavelength scale (up to several hundred nanometers). This is enabled by the fact that each particle in one system can couple directly into another while particles from the other systems interact only via the interlayer potential through a single interface.

We show that energy shifts, radiative lifetimes, and emission patterns of excitons and biexcitons in such rings can be tailored via the orientation of the individual dipoles. Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC). The field distribution in the most superradiant state in a full LHC multi-ring structure shows tight sub-wavelength field confinement in the central ring, while long-lived subradiant states store energy in the outer rings.",

Using these facts, we investigate the evolution of the cosmological perturbation on superhorizon scales in the universe dominated by oscillating multiple scalar fields which are generally interacting with each other, and the ratio of whose masses is incommensurable. Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved. As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.   From the viewpoint of the ergodic theory, it is discussed that as for the Bardeen parameter, the sigularities appear probabilistically.

We calculate the corresponding orbifold amplitudes from two viewpoints -- from the boundary state formalism and from the trace over the open string Hilbert space. It is shown that the topology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string in general do not coincide. For example the annulus sector for the short string contains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\\\"obius strip) of the long strings. The boundary\/cross-cap states of the short strings are classified into three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary and the cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection of two short strings.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum.

Two of them, SDSS J0100+2802 and SDSS J0306+1853 at redshift 6.326 and 5.363 respectively, are radio-quiet AGN according to the classic definition, while the third (B2 1023+25 at z=5.284) is a powerful blazar. The JVLA data clearly show a radio structure in the first source, and a radio emission with a relatively steep radio spectrum in the second one, demonstrating the presence of a radio jet and a diffuse component. Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift. The discovery of powerful relativistic jets associated with the most massive black holes in the early Universe re-opens the question: is the jet instrumental for a rapid growth of the black hole or instead is the black hole mass the main driver for the jet formation?",

Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time.

As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.   From the viewpoint of the ergodic theory, it is discussed that as for the Bardeen parameter, the sigularities appear probabilistically. This analysis serves the understanding of the evolution of the cosmological perturbations on superhorizon scales during reheating.",

In the absence of an external field, the superconducting phase is stable at a finite temperature above the critical point, while it disappears at zero temperature as soon as a nonzero external field is applied.

However, some universal behaviors are seen. For instance at low frequencies, real part of conductivity shows a delta function behavior while the imaginary part has a pole which means that these two parts are connected to each other through Kramers-Kronig relation. The behavior of real part of conductivity in the large frequency regime can be achieved by $Re[\\sigma]=\\omega^{D-4}$.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum.

Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity.

We treat a conducting polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling.

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes.

Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved.

For instance at low frequencies, real part of conductivity shows a delta function behavior while the imaginary part has a pole which means that these two parts are connected to each other through Kramers-Kronig relation. The behavior of real part of conductivity in the large frequency regime can be achieved by $Re[\\sigma]=\\omega^{D-4}$. Furthermore, with increasing the Lifshitz scaling $z$, the energy gap and the minimum values of the real and imaginary parts become unclear.",

The radio and gamma-ray observations are compared to the spectral energy distribution and the source variability observed at all wavelengths. The results indicate that the blazar exhibits an unusual emission structure, which is not described by a standard black hole model, and its spectral index decreases towards higher frequencies in the low energy part of the spectrum.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum.

We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling.

The outcome is, that shape coexistence may occur in certain islands on the nuclear map.

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

We calculate the corresponding orbifold amplitudes from two viewpoints -- from the boundary state formalism and from the trace over the open string Hilbert space. It is shown that the topology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string in general do not coincide. For example the annulus sector for the short string contains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\\\"obius strip) of the long strings. The boundary\/cross-cap states of the short strings are classified into three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary and the cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection of two short strings. We show that the sum of the all possible boundary conditions is equal to the exponential of the sum of the irreducible amplitude -- one body amplitude of long open (closed) strings.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties.",

We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift.

We treat a conducting polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling.

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved.

To explain the unexpected trend, changes of the nuclear structure far-off stability have been suggested, namely a quenching of the N=82 shell gap already in $^{130}$Cd, only two proton holes away from doubly magic $^{132}$Sn. We study the behaviour of the 2$^+$ energies in the Cd isotopes from N=50 to N=82, i.e. across the entire span of a major neutron shell using modern beyond mean field techniques and the Gogny force. We demonstrate that the observed low 2$^+$ excitation energy in $^{128}$Cd close to the N=82 shell closure is a consequence of the doubly magic character of this nucleus for oblate deformation favoring thereby prolate configurations rather than spherical ones.",

The spatial distribution of the CO (3-2)\/CO (1-0) integrated brightness temperature ratios mainly range between 0.3 and 0.8, which suggests that on average the CO (3-2) line in the Antennae is not completely thermalized and similar to the average values of nearby spirals. A higher ratio is seen in both nuclei and the southern complexes in the overlap region. Higher radiation field associated with intense star formation can account for the nucleus of NGC 4038 and the overlap region, but the nuclear region of NGC 4039 show relatively little star formation or AGN activities and cannot be easily explained.

After preparing the consistency conditions of the twisted boundary conditions for Annulus\/M\\\"obius\/Klein Bottle amplitudes in generic non-abelian orbifold, we classify the most general solutions of the constraints when the discrete group is $S_N$. We calculate the corresponding orbifold amplitudes from two viewpoints -- from the boundary state formalism and from the trace over the open string Hilbert space. It is shown that the topology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string in general do not coincide. For example the annulus sector for the short string contains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\\\"obius strip) of the long strings. The boundary\/cross-cap states of the short strings are classified into three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary and the cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection of two short strings. We show that the sum of the all possible boundary conditions is equal to the exponential of the sum of the irreducible amplitude -- one body amplitude of long open (closed) strings. This is typical structure of DLCQ partition function. We examined that the tadpole cancellation condition in our language and derived the well-known gauge group $SO(2^{13})$.",

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties.",

Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift.

We treat a conducting polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling.

We study stability of the Riemann problem amongst a large class of solutions. We show stability among the family of solutions with shocks from any family. We assume solutions verify at least one entropy condition. We have no small data assumptions. The solutions we consider are bounded and satisfy a strong trace condition weaker than $BV_{\\text{loc}}$. We make only mild assumptions on the system. In particular, our work applies to gas dynamics, including the isentropic Euler system and the full Euler system for a polytropic gas. We use the theory of a-contraction (see Kang and Vasseur [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 222(1):343--391, 2016]), and introduce new ideas in this direction to allow for two shocks from different shock families to be controlled simultaneously.

The outcome is, that shape coexistence may occur in certain islands on the nuclear map. The dual-shell mechanism predicts without any free parameters, that nuclei with proton number (Z) or neutron number (N) between 7-8, 17-20, 34-40, 59-70, 96-112, 146-168 are possible candidates for shape coexistence. In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

Using these facts, we investigate the evolution of the cosmological perturbation on superhorizon scales in the universe dominated by oscillating multiple scalar fields which are generally interacting with each other, and the ratio of whose masses is incommensurable. Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved. As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.

We find that half the CO (3-2) emission originates in the overlap region where most of the tidally induced star formation had been previously found in shorter wavelength images, with the rest being centered on each of the nuclei. The gross distribution is consistent with lower resolution single dish images, but we show for the first time the detailed distribution of the warm and dense molecular gas across this galaxy pair at resolutions comparable to the size of a typical giant molecular complex. While we find that 58% (33\/57) of the spatially resolved Giant Molecular Associations (GMAs; a few x 100 pc) are located in the overlap region, only \\leqq 30% spatially coincides with the optically detected star clusters, suggesting that the bulk of the CO (3-2) emission traces the regions with very recent or near future star formation activity. The spatial distribution of the CO (3-2)\/CO (1-0) integrated brightness temperature ratios mainly range between 0.3 and 0.8, which suggests that on average the CO (3-2) line in the Antennae is not completely thermalized and similar to the average values of nearby spirals. A higher ratio is seen in both nuclei and the southern complexes in the overlap region. Higher radiation field associated with intense star formation can account for the nucleus of NGC 4038 and the overlap region, but the nuclear region of NGC 4039 show relatively little star formation or AGN activities and cannot be easily explained. We show kinematical evidence that the high line ratio in NGC 4039 is possibly caused by gas inflow into the counter-rotating central disk.",

We also find evidence for morphological segregation, as late-type galaxies appear to be distributed within haloes of mass scales corresponding to groups and clusters up to about two virial radii, while passive objects show a preference to reside closer to the halo centre.

In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties.",

These choices are motivated by the extensive use of such algorithms to study a variety of high-energy processes, including the hard scattering at hadron colliders (HCD). We find that while the choice of the jet algorithm is important, it does not have any impact on our results regarding the angular dependence of the velocity distribution function of the Mueller--Navelet jets; thus we conclude that these two methods should be used interchangeably when studying the shape of this distribution.

A detailed numerical study of the error introduced by the small-cone approximation is also presented, for various observables of phenomenological interest. For values of the jet \"radius\" R=0.5, the use of the small-cone approximation amounts to an error of about 5% at the level of cross section, while it reduces to less than 2% for ratios of distributions such as those involved in the measure of the azimuthal decorrelation of dijets.",

Well below a surface-specific threshold field strength $E_d$, electron tunneling is mainly affected by the change of the metal workfunction, and is less sensitive to the detailed shape of the surface barrier. In particular, since the position of the image charge plane for electrons leaving the surface does not precisely coincide with the centroid of the induced screening charge at the surface in response to the applied electric field, we find an effective increase in the metal workfunction by $\\Delta W \\sim 0.01$ eV, which decreases the dark current.",

Importantly, it is shown that the resonances cause substantial broadening of the rho meson spectral density in matter and also induces non-trivial momentum dependence.

Two of them, SDSS J0100+2802 and SDSS J0306+1853 at redshift 6.326 and 5.363 respectively, are radio-quiet AGN according to the classic definition, while the third (B2 1023+25 at z=5.284) is a powerful blazar. The JVLA data clearly show a radio structure in the first source, and a radio emission with a relatively steep radio spectrum in the second one, demonstrating the presence of a radio jet and a diffuse component. Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift. The discovery of powerful relativistic jets associated with the most massive black holes in the early Universe re-opens the question: is the jet instrumental for a rapid growth of the black hole or instead is the black hole mass the main driver for the jet formation?",
