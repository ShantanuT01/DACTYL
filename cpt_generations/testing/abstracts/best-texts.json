In this work we present a theoretical analysis of electron transport in polymer nanofibers assuming them to be in conducting state. We treat a conducting polymer as a network of metallic-like grains embedded in poorly conducting environment, which consists of randomly distributed polymeric chains. We analyze the contribution from intergrain electron resonance tunneling via intermediate states localized on the polymeric chains between the grains. Correspondingly, we apply the quantum theory of conduction in mesoscopic systems to analyze this transport mechanism. We show that the contribution of resonance electron tunneling to the intergrain electron transport may be predominating, as follows from experiments on the electrical characterization of single polyaniline nanofibers. We study the effect of temperature on the transport characteristics. We represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath coupled to the intermediate state, which provides electron tunneling between the metallic-like grains. Using the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism combined with the nonequilibrium Green's functions technique, we show that temperature dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the intergrain electron tunneling, differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms in conducting polymers. Also, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the phonon bath may cause suppression of the original intermediate state accompanied by emergence of new states for electron tunneling.

In the light nuclei the nucleons flip from the HO shell to the neighboring SO-like shell, which means, that particle excitations occur. For this mass region, the predicted islands of shape coexistence, coincide with the islands of inversion. But in medium mass and heavy nuclei, in which the nucleons inhabit the SO-like shells, shape coexistence is accompanied by a merging of the SO-like shell with the open HO shell. The shell merging can be accomplished by the outer product of the SU(3) irreps of the two shells and represents the unification of the HO shell with the SO-like shell.",

Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size, which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9 and 16 dipoles as found in biological light harvesting complexes (LHC).

Using these facts, we investigate the evolution of the cosmological perturbation on superhorizon scales in the universe dominated by oscillating multiple scalar fields which are generally interacting with each other, and the ratio of whose masses is incommensurable. Since the scalar fields oscillate rapidly around the local minimum of the potential, we use the action angle variables. We found that this problem can be formulated as the canonical perturbation theory in which the perturbed part appearing as the result of the expansion of the universe and the interaction of the scalar fields is bounded by the negative power ot time. We show that by constructing the canonical transformations properly, the transformed hamiltonian becomes simple enough to be solved. As the result of the invetigation using the long wavelength limit and the canonical perturbation theory, under the sufficiently general conditions, we prove that for the adiabatic growing mode the Bardeen parameter stays constant and that for all the other modes the Bardeen parameter decays.

To explain this phenomenon, it may be necessary to consider both the well-known NN effects due to the strong correlation between the senior moment neighbour $1s$-states and well-deformed nuclei, and more difficultly quantified isomer effects, which seem to arise from a non-universal senior moment in $2^{+}$ isomers with odd seniority.

To explain the unexpected trend, changes of the nuclear structure far-off stability have been suggested, namely a quenching of the N=82 shell gap already in $^{130}$Cd, only two proton holes away from doubly magic $^{132}$Sn. We study the behaviour of the 2$^+$ energies in the Cd isotopes from N=50 to N=82, i.e. across the entire span of a major neutron shell using modern beyond mean field techniques and the Gogny force.

We find only one new unambiguous star cluster in addition to the five previously known in the M33 outer halo (10 kpc <= r <= 50 kpc). Although we identify 2440 cluster candidates of various degrees of confidence from our objective image search procedure, almost all of these are likely background contaminants, mostly faint unresolved galaxies. We measure the luminosity, color and structural parameters of the new cluster in addition to the five previously-known outer halo clusters. At a projected radius of 22 kpc, the new cluster is slightly smaller, fainter and redder than all but one of the other outer halo clusters, and has g' ~ 19.9, (g'-i') ~ 0.6, concentration parameter c ~ 1.0, a core radius r_c ~ 3.5 pc, and a half-light radius r_h ~ 5.5 pc. For M33 to have so few outer halo clusters compared to M31 suggests either tidal stripping of M33's outer halo clusters by M31, or a very different, much calmer accretion history of M33.",

After preparing the consistency conditions of the twisted boundary conditions for Annulus\/M\\\"obius\/Klein Bottle amplitudes in generic non-abelian orbifold, we classify the most general solutions of the constraints when the discrete group is $S_N$. We calculate the corresponding orbifold amplitudes from two viewpoints -- from the boundary state formalism and from the trace over the open string Hilbert space. It is shown that the topology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string in general do not coincide. For example the annulus sector for the short string contains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\\\"obius strip) of the long strings. The boundary\/cross-cap states of the short strings are classified into three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary and the cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection of two short strings. We show that the sum of the all possible boundary conditions is equal to the exponential of the sum of the irreducible amplitude -- one body amplitude of long open (closed) strings. This is typical structure of DLCQ partition function. We examined that the tadpole cancellation condition in our language and derived the well-known gauge group $SO(2^{13})$.",

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the observation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray flares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to 0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is found to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties.",

Therefore, being radio-quiet does not exclude the presence of a powerful relativistic jet with important consequences on the population studies and on the ratio between jetted and non-jetted AGN. We can estimate the viewing angle of these jets, and this allows us to find, albeit with some uncertainty, the density of black holes with a mass in excess of $10^{10}M_\\odot$ at high redshifts. We found that their density in jetted AGN is very large in the redshift bin 5-6, comparable with the overall AGN population of the same optical luminosity. Jets might thus play a crucial role in the fast formation and evolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe. They are more common than what expected from wide radio surveys with mJy flux sensitivity. Deeper JVLA or VLBI observations are key to discover a possible relativistic jet population hiding in plain sight at very high-redshift.
