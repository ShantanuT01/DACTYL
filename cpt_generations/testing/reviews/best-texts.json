        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",
