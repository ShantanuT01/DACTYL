        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

I love chocolate and when it comes to that, there aren't enough delicious desserts around so I am always on the lookout for new ideas!\n\nThe first four pages of this cookbook are simply fantastic: it appears as though each page has an all-in-one dessert listed",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.

I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.

I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

The first thing I noticed about the book is its beautiful design--the color photos are framed and printed on thick matte paper in full bleed format, so they look very much like photographs (i.e., no ink). Each page has several photos showing knitting needles of different types (handmade, electric) that match",
        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

Most of the desserts are classic chocolate cakes, cheesecakes, puddings, and cakes with chocolate frosting.\n\nThe author begins by explaining that chocolate is the perfect complement to coffee. The author goes on to explain how she chose to focus on baking desserts instead of other topics. In",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters!

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

        "text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a half dozen sweetened white chocolates made from chocolate chips or bars and various mixers like butterscotches, peanut butter kisses & peppermint.\n\nThere are 64 variations within this title featuring different mixes. Each is listed under four names -- these include everything from traditional treats through novel tastes and some new varieties -",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"What happens when two sisters join together to fight for victory in a hair styling championship? The result is \"Hair Show\" a poorly made movie that tries to be funny, tries to tell a comprehensive story, and tries to make its lead characters compelling but falls flat at every turn.<br \/><br \/>The direction of this movie is weak, and most every moment is predictable. After watching a few minutes, you can accurately predict what will happen at the end of the movie. It is one- hundred percent Hollywood formula from the beginning to the finish line. There is nothing unique or original in this film.<br \/><br \/>This movie stars Monique Imes- Jackson and Kellita Smith in the two lead roles and these two lasses are good enough to make some parts of the movie nearly bearable. They don't have very good chemistry between them and you already know how the story will end before it even gets started, but they at least offer some \"C\" grade performances.<br \/><br \/>The supporting cast of this movie is weak and most of them could have been replaced or eliminated completely from the movie without doing any damage. No one stands out in the supporting cast, and the director did a poor job in her selection. Add to that the stereotyping and the bad attempts at humor and you have an overall bad movie- one that should be avoided entirely if you have any respect for American made motion pictures.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

        "source_text":"Wow! I am amazed at how well this cleans my rugs. Before I ran my S5, I vacuumed my bedroom with my Shark stick vac. Closed the bedroom door and started the S5. When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

In the first book of this series, there were eight recipes, in the second two recipes have more chocolate flavors, and I found the third book has only six recipes.\n\nThese are all desserts for special occasions, such as weddings,",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

The story of this title goes like music without chorus: each new year introduces one-of-one, chocolate-based recipes that allow everyone who takes it on as an extra gift idea -- even when people receive the same type of gift twice during Christmas",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

        "text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a dozen recipes for chocolate desserts, all of which are sweet and satisfying.  This collection is divided into two main categories: the first five chapters contain no fewer than seven different types of cheesecakes--including one with espresso-infused vanilla bean cream cheese frosting; another featuring raspberry-chocolate ganache filling atop caramel",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up.

Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters!

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

The result is \"Hair Show\" a poorly made movie that tries to be funny, tries to tell a comprehensive story, and tries to make its lead characters compelling but falls flat at every turn.<br \/><br \/>The direction of this movie is weak, and most every moment is predictable. After watching a few minutes, you can accurately predict what will happen at the end of the movie. It is one- hundred percent Hollywood formula from the beginning to the finish line. There is nothing unique or original in this film.<br \/><br \/>This movie stars Monique Imes- Jackson and Kellita Smith in the two lead roles and these two lasses are good enough to make some parts of the movie nearly bearable. They don't have very good chemistry between them and you already know how the story will end before it even gets started, but they at least offer some \"C\" grade performances.<br \/><br \/>The supporting cast of this movie is weak and most of them could have been replaced or eliminated completely from the movie without doing any damage. No one stands out in the supporting cast, and the director did a poor job in her selection.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  While most books about knitting offer only the best techniques and patterns (e.g., Knitscope by Kate Moyer), The Yarn Story: From Spinning Wool To Twirling Fabric is different.\nWith no technical instructions to follow along with step-by-step illustrations on every single pattern page, one cannot simply try",
        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters!

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

The result is \"Hair Show\" a poorly made movie that tries to be funny, tries to tell a comprehensive story, and tries to make its lead characters compelling but falls flat at every turn.<br \/><br \/>The direction of this movie is weak, and most every moment is predictable. After watching a few minutes, you can accurately predict what will happen at the end of the movie. It is one- hundred percent Hollywood formula from the beginning to the finish line. There is nothing unique or original in this film.<br \/><br \/>This movie stars Monique Imes- Jackson and Kellita Smith in the two lead roles and these two lasses are good enough to make some parts of the movie nearly bearable. They don't have very good chemistry between them and you already know how the story will end before it even gets started, but they at least offer some \"C\" grade performances.<br \/><br \/>The supporting cast of this movie is weak and most of them could have been replaced or eliminated completely from the movie without doing any damage. No one stands out in the supporting cast, and the director did a poor job in her selection. Add to that the stereotyping and the bad attempts at humor and you have an overall bad movie- one that should be avoided entirely if you have any respect for American made motion pictures.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

        "source_text":"Wow! I am amazed at how well this cleans my rugs. Before I ran my S5, I vacuumed my bedroom with my Shark stick vac. Closed the bedroom door and started the S5. When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.

The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

Each recipe is perfectly adapted from the author\u2019s 2,100 recipes found on The Food Network website (\"The Chocolate Connoisseur\"), which has been viewed by over one million people.\n\nShaffer explains it best herself: \u201cIn my years of",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.

I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

The first few pages are dedicated to providing an overview of the author's approach to baking--a combination of traditional techniques with modern twists--and then the recipes begin.\n\nI'm happy to report that the author",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters!

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.

The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters!

I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

Chocolate can indeed be made a little messy in cooking but it",
        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

They don't have very good chemistry between them and you already know how the story will end before it even gets started, but they at least offer some \"C\" grade performances.<br \/><br \/>The supporting cast of this movie is weak and most of them could have been replaced or eliminated completely from the movie without doing any damage. No one stands out in the supporting cast, and the director did a poor job in her selection. Add to that the stereotyping and the bad attempts at humor and you have an overall bad movie- one that should be avoided entirely if you have any respect for American made motion pictures.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

        "source_text":"Wow! I am amazed at how well this cleans my rugs. Before I ran my S5, I vacuumed my bedroom with my Shark stick vac. Closed the bedroom door and started the S5. When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

When it was done, the dust bin was 1\/4 filled. I was amazed. I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.  Microphone, Camera, Your Contacts, Your Photos, Your personal iPhone Profile data, Facebook, Google......<br \/><br \/>- If you dont Sign Out each time you use the MI Home app., it rapidly drains your iphone battery",

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side.

        "source_text":"Bev Shaffer's \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren't tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br \/><br \/>The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de cr\u00e8me, white chocolate coeur a la cr\u00e8me with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you'll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use.

        "source_text":"No doubt many knitters will receive this handsome, oversized coffee-table book as a birthday or Christmas gift from a nonknitting friend or relative.  More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.  It is interesting to dip into, but its size and weight make it impractical for carry-along or bedtime reading, and the text is generally lacking in depth.  The book does include an excellent index.<br \/><br \/>In its presentation, KNITOPEDIA is similar to a couple of my old knitting-book-collector favorites, [[ASIN:0831727918 Encyclopedia of Knitting Techniques]], and [[ASIN:0934026416 The Illustrated Dictionary of Knitting]], but it has less how-to information.  The book is much more complete than [[ASIN:0762408057 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING: A Step-by-Step Visual Guide, With an Inspirational Gallery of Finished Works]], except that it has no stitch treasury section.<br \/><br \/>I award KNITOPEDIA 3 stars because it is a coffee-table book, rather than a \"complete knitting reference\" that would be a knitter's one go-to source for information on how to knit, knitting history, and famous knitters.  However, if considered as a coffee-table book alone, KNITOPEDIA easily merits 5 stars.",

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",

For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br \/><br \/>I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de cr\u00e8me. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br \/><br \/>The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I've reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don't have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br \/><br \/>Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you'll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br \/><br \/>(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)",

I am so happy I purchased this little guy<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-On initial startup, mapped every edge of the perimiter of the room<br \/>-Excellent job covering the entire room. Systematically travels back and forth and adjusts direction to vac areas missed on the first pass due to furniture legs.<br \/>- No problem navigating rugs, area rugs and memory foam rugs.<br \/>- Adjusts suction when it climbs onto a rug or climbs down to the wood floor.<br \/>- Cleaned under everything without getting hung up. Moves right along on its treaded wheels.<br \/>- Did not get stuck on any cords<br \/>-When it encounters an object it barely bunps it and immediaterly adjusts direction. The amazing thing was watching it move around to ensure it vacuumed all areas as close to that obstacle as possible. Very impressive.<br \/>- Quieter than my Shark stick vac<br \/>- Returned to its dock, engaged with the charger contacts and began recharging as soon as vac was done. No problems at all.  My S5 dock and plastic docking pad are located under a bench, on a rug.<br \/>- Washable filters! (comes with 2) that are super easy to remove and wash<br \/>- Dust bin is accessed via the top of the unit and is easy to remove, empty and replace without having to pickup the unit.<br \/>- Added little bonus, it talks ....letting you know each function it performs, when that function begins and when it ends. I didn\u2019t realize it talked when I purchased it. You can control the volume with the app.<br \/>- Once the app was installed and connected, it has been very easy to use. Pretty intuitive with lots of features.<br \/>- Packaging is excellent. Tripple boxed:. Roborock storage box inside another Roborock box, inside an Amazon shipping box.  The Roborock storage box has an easy access flip top and a secure plastic handle.  There\u2019s no styrofoam packing material - YAY!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It took me 2 days to finally get the S5 to connect to my wifi via the app. It was so frustrating and the app. gives no feedback as to why it would not connect. I spent so much time researching and trying to get it to connect I was really annoyed.  I was on the verge of shipping it back for a refund when, for no apparent reason, on maybe the 20th try, it finally connected and enabled the app. features.  What a nightmare!<br \/><br \/>- **** Be mindful of the permissions you grant the Mi Home app. ***<br \/>It tries to control way too many modules and all the data in your iphone, iCloud, home wifi network and social media accounts. I went thru all the screens and turned off all of the permissions which are not necessary for the S5 to work.

More of a dictionary than an encyclopedia, this \"complete knitting reference\" consists of an A-Z list of knitting terms (purl stitch, guerilla knitting, jacquard, storing yarn, etc.), knitting luminaries (Ann Budd, Emma Jacobsson, Jane Slicer-Smith, etc.), knitting magazines (Knitter's, Knitscene, McCall's Needlework & Crafts, etc.), and knitting events (Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, etc.).<br \/><br \/>Each alphabetical entry is described or explained in one or more short paragraphs; many entries are accompanied by  drawings, illustrations, or full-color photographs.  Some entries are comprised of brief essays presented in boxed text (e.g., \"Arctic Gold\" by Linda Cortright, about qiviut;  \"Designing Knitted Lace\" by Margaret Stove; \"Knitting in Media\" by Vickie Howell).  Although long-time knitters will recognize many of the how-to drawings as drawings originally published in the publisher's excellent but venerable reference, [[ASIN:193154316X Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book]], KNITOPEDIA offers  a lot of new and different material.<br \/><br \/>KNITOPEDIA will be a welcome gift to any knitter, but it is definitely not a must-have technical reference for the serious knitter.

Add to that the stereotyping and the bad attempts at humor and you have an overall bad movie- one that should be avoided entirely if you have any respect for American made motion pictures.",

It came already assembled and we didn't have to screw or glue anything.

        "source_text":"First, the color and fabric of this stroller is amazing. I'm loving the burgundy, but it also feels so nice and soft. Assembly wise, it was pretty simple. Attach wheels. Attach seat. Attach accessories. Took about 10 minutes. The stroller itself is very sturdy. It is a little wider than my other single strollers. The cup holder and bag make it even wider, but in narrow spots you can just remove the accessories. The stroller is versatile. The seat has multiple recline positions. The foot can be down or up. It can face the parent or the road. You can put it in a flat prom-like position. It also has adaptors to use with a Maxi-Cosi infant seat. The base itself is all black, so the infant seat color won't not match, if that is an issue for you. The harness on the seat is a puzzle harness, which can be a little tricky to get used to, but make it so even if a Wiley toddler manages to push the button to unclip the harness, it is still connected, giving you time before they escape into the wild. The only real concern I have is the basket fabric underneath. It just looks thin and looks weak in the sewn areas. I do love that the back of the basket can fold down for easier storage use. But I worry about putting anything too heavy underneath. The front wheels are lockable or unlockable. It turns and drives very smoothly for a standard stroller. It works well for walking outdoors. I wouldn't use it for running or jogging, but walking works really well. It also folds up without having to remove the seat, which is a good thing. It is on the heavy side. It is sturdy, but you pay for that in the weight. I can lift it, but it is far from light weight.",
